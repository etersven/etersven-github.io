            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone! I’m Otwo, originally from Thailand, and I moved to Japan in March 2024 to continue my university education. </br>
            My fascination with Japanese music began in my childhood, but it was in 2020 that I truly fell in love with J-pop. </br>
            This marked the beginning of my journey to Japan. It all started when I watched a drama featuring idols from Starto Entertainment.</br>
            Captivated by their performances, I began following their YouTube channel. Although I had always been interested in the Japanese language,</br>
            my desire to understand the idols better drove me to study it seriously.

I dedicated six months to studying at a language school and passed the JLPT N3 in December 2023 while applying to Japanese universities. Since moving to Japan, I've been thrilled to find that people, especially native Japanese speakers, are often surprised by my proficiency in the language despite my short time here. My passion for the idols motivated me to immerse myself in Japanese culture—watching TV series, movies, YouTube videos, listening to radio shows, and songs. Although my language skills are a result of diligent study, I owe my success to the inspiration and motivation the idols provided. Living in Japan, surrounded by the same sights and sounds as my idols, fuels my ambition to continue my studies.</p>
